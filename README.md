## About
[all.txt](https://github.com/Me871/TheGreatBoredom/blob/main/all.txt) was orignally sourced from [Trilzo's Useless-er Button](https://trilzo.com/), which you can use to go to a random website from most of this list. Soon, the websites will also be added to category files to help with finding something to do.
